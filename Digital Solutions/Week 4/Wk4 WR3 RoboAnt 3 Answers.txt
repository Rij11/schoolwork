Q1 Answer (Define): 

RoboAnt must take the shortest path from the starting position to obtain a marker, deposit it in the 'acid bath' then return to the starting position.
RoboAnt must navigate around a barrier wall stopping him from going into the acid bath to get to the table.
The table changes its position along a horizontal axis every time the code is run.
RoboAnt must then go south of the table to pick up the marker.
RoboAnt must drop the marker into the acid bath before returning to the starting position.



Q2 Answer (Analyse):

Using a for loop, RoboAnt will head north until he is aligned with the table.
Using a while Front is clear loop, move RoboAnt to the table. RoboAnt will stop before hitting the table.
Using a for loop move RoboAnt due south and across to the marker.
After picking up the marker, using a while front is clear loop RoboAnt will move to the acid bath.
Stopping before hitting the acid bath. RoboAnt will then maneuver into the acid bath where he will drop the marker.
Then using for loops RoboAnt will return to his starting position.

Q5:

By Tuesday- Read and understand (plan) task for RoboAnt Activity 3
By Wednesday- RoboAnt will be able to travel to the table & stop before hitting it.
By Thursday- RoboAnt will be able to move south of the table, pick up the marker and drop it in the acid bath then return home.
By Friday- Finalise code, check for errors and maximise code efficiency.



Q6: -- paste code



Q7: -- Word Doc



Q8:

I was able to achieve my criteria. I was able to complete the tasks I had set within the time frames I had given myself.
I recommend that I spend more time checking and understanding the task as well as making it more efficient at the end.
